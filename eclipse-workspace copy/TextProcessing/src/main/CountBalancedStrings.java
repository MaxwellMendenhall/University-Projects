/** 
 * Balanced strings are those who have equal quantity of "L" and
 * "R" characters. Given a balanced string s split it in the maximum
 * amount of balanced strings. Return the maximum amount of splitted
 * balanced strings
 * Example 1:
 * input: "RLRRLLRLRL"
 * output: 4
 * Explanation: "RLRRLLRLRL" can be split into "RL", "RRLL", "RL", "RL",
 * since each substring contains the same number of "L" and R"
 * Example 2:
 * input: "RLLLLRRRLR"
 * output: 3
 * Explanation: "RLLLLRRRLR" can be split into "RL", "LLLRRR","LR",
 * since each substring contains the same number of "L" and "R"
 * Example 3:
 * input: "LLLLRRRR"
 * output: 1
 * Explanation: "LLLLRRRR" can be split into "LLLLRRRR"
 * Example 4:
 * input: "RLRRRLLRLL"
 * output: 2
 * Explanation: "RLRRRLLRLL" can be split into "RL", "RRRLLRLL",
 * since each substring contains the same number of "L" and "R"
 * Please write a program to achieve this goal and name it CountBalancedStrings.java
